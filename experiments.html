Prior to the experiment, yeast cultures were grown in synthetic complete uracil dropout medium with 2% glucose as a carbon source. The optical density (OD600) was in the range 0.2-0.6. Cultures were imaged under a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope. The following settings were used for the imaging: 25 ms exposure time for brightfield or phase-contrast, 100 ms exposure time for EGFP channel. Colibri LED modules were used as a source of 470 nm excitation at 25% intensity. Nile red was excited with the 470 nm LED for 5 ms. The fluorescence intensities were quantified using ImageJ.</p>

Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope with 63C/1.4NA oil immersion objective and Axiocam 506 mono camera was used for imaging. The focus was kept using Definite Focus and the sample was kept at 30 Â°C using PeCon TempControl 37-2 digital.

We used BioTek Synergy MX microplate reader to measure the cellsâ optical density and intensity of EGFP fluorescence. All strains used in the experiments were pre-grown overnight at 30 Â°C in liquid CSM/2%Glc media and diluted to OD600 in a range of 0.9 to 1.1. Then diluted cell cultures were distributed to 96 well plates (clear flat bottom). For replicates of two colonies from each strain were analyzed. 200 ÂµL of cells were added to each well. CSM/2%Glc media was used as a reference to OD600. The measurements were done with the following parameters. Absorbance was measured at 600 nm and fluorescence was measured at the following conditions: excitation 485 nm, emission 528 nm, bandwidth 20, gain 80.</p>
